I checked out this piece today on Thrillist. I don't think it's meant to be anything more than humorous, but it touches on what is a hot topic these days: gentrification.

The author is not alone in mourning the gentrification of his neighborhood. Over the past five to ten years, I've seen myriad articles and think pieces, and even some academic studies into the phenomenon. Going further back, one of my favorite movies, [Boyz N the Hood][0], dedicated a brief scene to it. Yet for all this ink spilled, I think gentrification is still poorly understood.

The [OED][1] defines gentrification as "\[t\]he process by which an (urban) area is rendered middle-class." Its root word is gentry, which refers variously to "gentlemen," people of "good breeding," and "the class immediately below the nobility."

Though the dictionary definition is decidedly vague, as it's used today, gentrification is almost always focused on four key components:

young, upwardly mobile white people move in; the pricey chains and       boutique shops that young, upwardly mobile white people patronize move in; the poor and ethnic minorities move out; established businesses catering to the poor and ethnic minorities who currently inhabit the area move out.

More succinctly: gentrification is the process by which poor people are displaced from their neighborhood due to rising prices. This is, almost universally, understood to be a bad thing. I am going to play devil's advocate and argue that it's not a good thing or a bad thing, just a thing.

If you are poor, you can't afford nice things. I'll leave the Whys for another day, but suffice to say that being poor is not fun. A lot of things are out of your reach when you don't have money. Turns out, nice neighborhoods are one of them.

Why that deserves its own name, I'm not sure. When we talk about how poor people can't afford quality health care, we don't call it gentrification. When we talk about how poor people can't afford quality food, we don't call it gentrification. When we talk about how poor people can't afford quality education, we don't call it gentrification. So why, when we talk about how poor people can no longer afford their suddenly nice neighborhoods, do we call it gentrification?

Perhaps it's because gentrification is necessarily a process of poor people _losing_ access to something, rather than never gaining access in the first place. Taking the above OED definition and etymology, I suppose it could also come from the assumed subjectivity of the gentry. That is to say, wealthy people move into a neighborhood and change it to suit their subjective, upscale tastes, all the while pushing prices up for the existing residents.

Of course talks of gentrification often begin at the sight of a new bike lane, or a rehabbed park. We tread dangerously when we ascribe those things to the gentry, as though poor people or minorities wouldn't benefit from or appreciate those things.

And that is perhaps my biggest problem with gentrification as a concept: in a roundabout way it assigns values to people based on class. I'm OK with believing that poor people aren't super interested in eating at Lemonade or shopping at Warby Parker. But safer streets and better schools? Those are things everyone benefits from.

And when a neighborhood becomes more desirable, because it's safer, cleaner, or what have you, the demand for that neighborhood goes up. And people with money will always be able to outbid people without money.

I don't think it's fair to say or assume that poor people should be stuck in neighborhoods like the author remembers teeming with junkies ready to punch you out. That's no place to raise a family.

One might wonder where the police were in those days. That's a great question, and one I don't have an answer to, though I have a lot of speculative thoughts (crime tends to concentrate in poor neighborhoods on its own, wealthier people are more likely to call the police than poor people, etc.).
