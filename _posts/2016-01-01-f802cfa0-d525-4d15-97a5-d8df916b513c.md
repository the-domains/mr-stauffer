I listened to season one of the _Serial _podcast (way late, I know), and the introduction of the first episode struck me because it opened with an impossible question: how can you verify your whereabouts on any given day if somebody needed to know? null

Sarah Keonig sets up the criminal case as hinging on Adnan Sayed's whereabouts at a very narrow window of time. To illustrate the difficulty of Adnan's case she asks several people where they were on a specific date six weeks ago. Predictably, few remember even the most basic details of where they were on that date.

Adnan's case and much of the _Serial _story takes place in 1999 when he and the main players were in high school. This is significant because much of the case for and against Adnan hinges on his whereabouts at specific times. In 1999 this was done by checking cell phone records, specifically, locating the towers that a phone "pinged" to make a call.

Many people's first reactions to this knowledge is skepticism and fear, and that's not an unreasonable reaction. Knowing that your cell phone manufacturer, your wireless provider, any number of third party companies, the police, etc. have access to your whereabouts to within a few inches could make anyone uneasy.

And that technology is certainly ripe for abuse. But I'm interested in the positive applications of such technology. I don't want to compare my situation to Adnan's--a parking ticket vs. a murder rap--but on a very surface level, Big Data helped me.

I received a parking ticket from the City of Santa Monica recently for parking at an expired meter. The problem was I was not at that meter, nor anywhere in Santa Monica that day. When I received the ticket notice in the mail my first thought was, "I don't remember getting a ticket." When I looked at the date of the violation, I went to my personal and work calendars and saw I was in the office all day. The ticket was issued on a weekday, just before 1:00 p.m. Unless I went to Santa Monica for lunch or a work errand--not impossible but highly unlikely--there is no way I was guilty.

Next I checked my receipts. If I went out for lunch that day, and could find a receipt from a restaurant near my office, I could prove I wasn't in Santa Monica. Alas, I had no receipts and my credit and debit card receipts turned up nothing. If I went out to lunch that day, I must have paid cash and tossed the receipt.

Then I remembered two critical technologies that ultimately got my ticket dismissed: Google Location History, and Automatic. Google Location History probably runs unbeknownst to millions of people. If you have a Google account and GPS on your phone, Google probably has a record of everywhere you've been, every day. Google "Google Location Services," sign-in, and see for yourself.

You can use the drop-down menus to select the date, and Google shows a map of your travel that day. Mine showed that my phone left my house around 8:30 a.m., arrived at work at 9, and stayed there all day (I probably brought my lunch to work that day so I didn't even leave the office).

Automatic is a small device that plugs into your car's on-board diagnostic computer (OBD). It reads your car's "check engine" codes, tells you when you're driving inefficiently, and remembers where you parked. That last one is relevant here: Automatic links with your smartphone over Bluetooth, and uses your phone's GPS to locate your car. Every time you turn the key on or off, and as you drive, Automatic is tracking your car's location.

Using much the same interface as Google Location History, I was able to trace my car's whereabouts on the day in question and, lo and behold, it matched up perfectly with my phone's. This is important because a city looking to collect ticket revenue could easily say that just because my phone was in Inglewood doesn't mean my car wasn't illegally parked in Santa Monica.

Automatic was the extra evidence I needed to prove my innocence: neither I nor my car were in Santa Monica that day.

Now, Big Data only helped me get out of a $52 parking ticket. But there are enough cases where knowing a person's whereabouts could have gotten them out of something much more serious. Adnan might not be sitting in jail if he could have reliably proven that he was at the library rather than at the scene of a murder. Louis Gonzalez III relied on cash register receipts and security video to verify his whereabouts.
