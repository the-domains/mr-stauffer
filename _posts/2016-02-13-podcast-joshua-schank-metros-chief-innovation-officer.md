I listened to this interview with Metro's new Chief Innovation Officer, Joshua Schank. It's a great primer on where Metro is in terms of its life cycle. Much of the interview focuses on Metro's embrace of public-private partnerships (P3) for infrastructure construction and finance.

He also compares Metro favorably to other transit systems he's used. In my own, much more limited experience, I also have a favorable impression of Metro. I've used BART, NYC MTA, Unitrans (Davis, CA), DART (Dublin, Ireland), Long Beach Transit, and more. Of the major metro area systems in the U.S. that I've used (NYC and BART), I've found Metro to be cleaner, cheaper, and the payment system easier to understand and use.

That's not to say that Metro is not without its faults.
